<h1>Mafi Mafi</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Mafi Mafi is an existing clothing company based out of Ethiopia that pushes the boundary of Ethiopian traditional clothing into the modern era. I have been following the designer <em>Mahlet Afework</em>.The company is currently selling their products directly through their store located in Addis Ababa and showing their products through Instagram.

My motivation for creating this project was to create a website to show case the current items at their store based on their instagram posts, and allow users to create their own account and purchase these items securely through stripe checkout. The aim of the website is to promote Mafi Mafi which is a small black owned business. 


<h3>User Stories</h3>
The website currently allows:

  <li>Users to log in and logout of the application</li>

2.The website has a zoom in feature in order for users to zoom in on clothing items to get a better view of the product.
